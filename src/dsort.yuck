Usage: datesort [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Sort contents of FILE chronologically.
If FILE is omitted read from stdin.

The first date/time value per line is the sort key.  Dates without times
account for a smaller value than any date/time on the same day.  Times
without dates account for a smaller value than any date or date/time.
If a line contains no dates or times or date/times it is sorted towards
the front.
