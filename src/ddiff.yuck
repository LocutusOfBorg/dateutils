Usage: ddiff [OPTION]... DATE/TIME [DATE/TIME]...

Compute duration from DATE/TIME (the reference date/time) to the other
DATE/TIMEs given and print the result as duration.
If the other DATE/TIMEs are omitted read them from stdin.

DATE/TIME can also be one of the following specials
  - `now'           interpreted as the current (UTC) time stamp
  - `time'          the time part of the current (UTC) time stamp
  - `today'         the current date (according to UTC)
  - `tomo[rrow]'    tomorrow's date (according to UTC)
  - `y[ester]day'   yesterday's date (according to UTC)

Note: The output format of durations (specified via -f) takes all format
specifiers into account, i.e. specifying %M and %S for example prints the
duration in minutes and seconds, whereas specifying %S only prints the duration
in seconds.

See section `The refinement rule' in ddiff(1).

  -h, --help                 Print help and exit
  -V, --version              Print version and exit
  -q, --quiet                Suppress message about date/time and duration
                             parser errors and fix-ups.
                             The default is to print a warning or the
                             fixed up value and return error code 2.
  -f, --format=STRING        Output format.  This can either be a specifier
                               string (similar to strftime()'s FMT) or the name
                               of a calendar.
  -i, --input-format=STRING...  Input format, can be used multiple times.
                               Each date/time will be passed to the input
                               format parsers in the order they are given, if a
                               date/time can be read successfully with a given
                               input format specifier string, that value will
                               be used.
  -e, --backslash-escapes    Enable interpretation of backslash escapes in the
                               output and input format specifier strings.
      --from-zone=ZONE       Interpret dates on stdin or the command line as
                               coming from the time zone ZONE.
