Usage: dategrep [OPTION]... EXPRESSION

Grep standard input for lines that match EXPRESSION.

EXPRESSION may be date/times prefixed with an operator `<', `<=', `=', `>=',
`>', `!=', `<>' (if omitted defaults to `='),
which will match lines with date/times which are older, older-equal, equal,
newer-equal, newer, or not equal respectively.

EXPRESSION may also be format specifiers infixed by above operators
and suffixed by a value (e.g. `%a="Wed"') which matches lines whose
%a representation (weekday name abbreviated) is "Wed".

EXPRESSION may be statements as described above concatenated through `&&' (for
conjunction) or `||' (disjunction), both of which may be parenthesised as per
usual to change precedence (`&&' goes over `||').

If multiple date/times occur on the same line and any one of them fulfills the
criteria then the line is considered a match and will be output.

  -h, --help                 Print help and exit
  -V, --version              Print version and exit
  -q, --quiet                Suppress message about date/time and duration
                               parser errors.
  -i, --input-format=STRING...  Input format, can be used multiple times.
                               Each date/time will be passed to the input
                               format parsers in the order they are given, if a
                               date/time can be read successfully with a given
                               input format specifier string, that value will
                               be used.
  -b, --base=DT              For underspecified input use DT as a fallback to
                             fill in missing fields.  Also used for ambiguous
                             format specifiers to position their range on the
                             absolute time line.
                             Must be a date/time in ISO8601 format.
                             If omitted defaults to the current date/time.
  -e, --backslash-escapes    Enable interpretation of backslash escapes in the
                               output and input format specifier strings.
  -o, --only-matching        Show only the part of a line matching DATE.
  -v, --invert-match         Select non-matching lines.
      --from-zone=ZONE  Consider date/times on stdin as coming from the
                        zone ZONE, default: UTC.
  -z, --zone=ZONE       Consider date/times in EXPRESSION as coming from
                        the zone ZONE, default: UTC.

Note:
  Operations can be specified by options (--eq, --gt, ...) as well.
  This serves solely as a means of convenience, e.g. the dtest tool has a
  similar syntax.

      --eq                   Lines match when date/times are equal to
                               EXPRESSION.
      --ne                   Lines match when date/times are not the same as
                               EXPRESSION.
      --gt                   Lines match when date/times are newer than
                               EXPRESSION.
      --lt                   Lines match when date/times are older than
                               EXPRESSION.
      --ge                   Lines match when date/times are newer than or
                               equal EXPRESSION.
      --le                   Lines match when date/times are older than or
                               equal EXPRESSION.
      --nt                   Lines match when date/times are newer than or
                               equal EXPRESSION.
      --ot                   Lines match when date/times are older than or
                               equal EXPRESSION.
