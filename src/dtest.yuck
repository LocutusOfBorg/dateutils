      --gt                   DATE/TIME1 is newer than DATE/TIME2
      --lt                   DATE/TIME1 is older than DATE/TIME2
      --ge                   DATE/TIME1 is newer than or equals DATE/TIME2
      --le                   DATE/TIME1 is older than or equals DATE/TIME2
      --nt                   DATE/TIME1 is newer than DATE/TIME2
      --ot                   DATE/TIME1 is older than DATE/TIME2
      --cmp                  compare DATE/TIME1 to DATE/TIME2, return with 0 if
                               equal, 1 if left argument was newer and 2 if
                               right argument was newer
